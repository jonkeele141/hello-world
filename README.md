These snawsberries taste like snawsberries!
I'm a crappy coder, with enthusiasm!! so if youre looking for a noob to ruin your code and push all of my changes to your master branch just @me lol I'm a pretty good hacker though, not usually intentionally, but I will mistakenly start a trojan horse or malware the likes of which this world has never seen so if you're a security researcher my profile could be a good starting point! just kidding I'm just starting to get ok-ish at coding.
